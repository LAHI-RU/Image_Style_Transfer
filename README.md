# Image_Style_transfer
 This project demonstrates *Neural Style Transfer (NST)* using deep learning. The goal is to transfer the style of one image (e.g., a painting) onto the content of another image (e.g., a photograph). The implementation uses a *pre-trained VGG19 model* for feature extraction and optimization techniques to minimize the content and style losses.
